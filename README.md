# Gene Expression Disease Preediction

## Description
In this project, we explored the relationship between genes and cancer types using machine learning and interactive visualization. Our machine learning analysis consists of unsupervised clustering of genes and principal component analysis, as well as supervised modeling for feature selection and disease prediction. In our interactive visualization, you can hover over different organs (Blood, Kidney, Breast, Lung) to explore a bar graph of the most important genes for predicting that organ's cancer type, and a heat map of gene expression levels for that cancer type.

## Online Access
The d3 visualization for our project is hosted here: https://ktynes.github.io/GeneExpression/

## Installation & Execution
Firstly, you need to create a python3 virtual environment. Do this by installing the requirements in requirements.txt and run run.py. Lastly, navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8000/ to view the visualization.
